## Dragon Game
#### Title of the game will be decided later.

Hi!
It was one of these boring classes, I decided that it would be nice to entertain myself with something cool.
Therefore, I thought it would be nice to start a side project I would be working on only during these kind of classes.
I am curious how fast can I develop a web-based game by only writing it during boring classes.
Of course being in class and working on a project means I can not really dedicate my full attention to either of the two.
Regardless of that I consider it a very interesting *experiment*.

**Idea for a game**

In my early teenage years I used to play a very cool browser game.
Player would create an account and choose their first dragon's egg.
Egg had to be incubated for couple of days until the dragon was hatched.
An already hatched dragon would be fed to grow and depending on food it would recieve,
it would develop different strenghts and weaknesses.
Later dragons would be sent on adventures to bring resources used for trading and events.
Dragons could also fight one another for trophys and rank in a leaderboard.
Game was very iddle in its nature and a lot of fun around the game was the text-based roleplay and the community.

**Building a modern dragon training game**

Of course I am not going to build a browser game with PHP that does not hold to modern standards.
I want to keep the idle mechanics, the thrill of sending dragon on an adventure, option for a nice
roleplay and community building.
For now I am going to keep my options for tech stack open and experiment.
